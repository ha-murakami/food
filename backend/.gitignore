#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
/backend!/log/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
/backend!/tmp/pids/
/backend!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
/backend!/storage/.keep

/public/assets
/api.byebug_history
